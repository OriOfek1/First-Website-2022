 - To run your website All you have to do is simply double-click on index.html.
 
 - The input validation I performed in the contact me form was:
    1.Specifing "requierd" in all fields of the contact form.
    2.Using the email type in the form which requries a basic email validation of using "@".

 - The purpose of the JavaScript code on my website:
    1.navSlide - Used mainly for mobile - the burger's navigation bar script.
    The burger refers to the three horizontal lines at the top left corner.
    Listens onclicks on a nav-link and slides in from the right an alternate navbar for mobile.

    2.imageGallery - a function the implements the food gallery's logic.
    "highlight" is the the picture that is currently on display.
    "food-active" is the small picture in the previews of the higlight that's displayed.We only have 1 food-active at a time.
    On click we display the photo that was clicked(from the "food-previews"), and make it the "food-active" while removing the previous one.
